Implementation of Adelson-Velskii & Landis tree aka AVL Tree. It's a type of a binary tree which does self balancing for every new insertion.
Self balancing keeps the search complexity, for which is used, O(logn) since it should ideally have logn depth to reduce the workload.
It's written in a way that its autobalance should have very little impact.
Since it doesn't have makefile yet you can compile it simply with
gcc -c *.c
gcc -o executableName *.o
or use it in an IDE.
TODO
Add makefile
Add self balancing while deleting elements
