Implementation of Adelson-Velskii & Landis tree aka AVL Tree. It's a type of a binary tree which does self balancing for every new insertion.
Self balancing keeps the search complexity, for which is used, O(logn) since it should ideally have logn depth to reduce the workload.
It's written in a way that its autobalance should have very little impact.
Added script for creating makefile. Compile like this:
./configure
make
